This cli tool can be used to access FTP severs and it can create , delete, upload, download, and show files or directories there are still some problems with this but i am still learning and i will try to fix if i can. Thank you 
and here is the manual 
second edit the config.ini with `nano config.ini`
then run the app with `python app.py`
upload =  `upload local_file_location  remote_file_location` (always give a filename in the remote file loaction otherwise it will freak you out)
download = same as upload just alter the paths
preview show filename
delete delete filename
makedir mkdir dir-name
Thanks for reading this trash
